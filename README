winbind

This is the winbind module.

Currently it satisfies the *very specific* example of configuring winbind, krb5
and PAM to enable SSH via Active Directory authentication

DO NOT USE IT IN ANY OTHER CASE, because it'll blat your samba config, krb5 config
and make your day unhappy.

If you do want to use it, go ahead, but you should be very aware that it will blat

/etc/samba/smb.conf
/etc/krb5.conf
/etc/pam.d/sshd
/etc/nsswitch.conf

It also stops nscd, because winbind and nscd don't play nicely together

unless you edit the templates up front
